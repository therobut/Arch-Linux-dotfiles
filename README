Pretty self-explanatory. Just run makesymlinks-archlinux.sh

Other versions of makesymlinks-<distro>.sh are coming soon.

-- Known Issues --
------------------

Need to add a symlink for the awesome config folder to the makesymlinks script.
 -Temporary fix is to manually create a symlink to it.
  EXAMPLE:   $ ln -s ~/dotfiles/awesome ~/.config/

Need to remove 'oh-my-zsh' and add the official repository as a submodule.
It works as-is, but it cannot be easily updated currently.
