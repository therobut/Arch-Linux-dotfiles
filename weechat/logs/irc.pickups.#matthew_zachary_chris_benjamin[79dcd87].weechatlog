2016-01-23 13:25:52	JoelCain	I like it quite a bit.. I'm becoming married to the command line more and more. Especially since I'm becoming more familiar with vim and git and such. As of right now, I only use the my mouse for gaming, and my budget program (since it is GUI driven). Other than that everything is manipulated by my keyboard. I quite enjoy it lol
2016-01-23 13:26:24	JoelCain	well, i should say i only use my mouse when I'm in Windows or using my budget app lol
